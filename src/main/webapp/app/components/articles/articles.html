										Is your software development organization performing as it should?  Wherever you are on the 
										continuum, it's important to identify where you need to go and how to get there, because organizations 
										need a clear vision to help everyone drive in the same direction. We should evaluate our processes, 
										technology, product line, documentation, culture, and our people themselves. But, what do we evaluate 
										them against? How do we measure our progress? I believe there are three key measuring sticks for evaluating 
										a team or organization, and if we keep these things in focus productivity will skyrocket.

										<ul>
											<li>Quality</li>
											<li>Efficiency</li>
											<li>Balance</li>
										</ul>
										Let's look closely at each one.

								Making Accurate Software Project Estimates

										Estimation is just hard. Unfortunately, it's also very necessary. Companies use estimates to project out 
										release schedules, make commitments to their customers, decide whether a proposed feature is worth implementing, 
										track teams' velocity, and prioritize the work effectively. Executives often want to know when a feature or 
										deliverable will be ready for production. After all, software development is not a trivial investment. 
										Without estimates, how would the project manager make an assessment? If humans could predict the future 
										accurately, people wouldn't only win at horse races 2% of the time. Estimation is the great conundrum. 
										It's essential and necessary for companies to ask their people to do the impossible: predict the future.
									</p>
									<p>
										First, let's review some popular estimation methods (in case you missed some of the excitement). Then we 
										can look at what this means to us and our projects.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://toughnickel.com/business/Estimating-Software-Projects-Effectively" target="_new">[READ MORE]</a><br/>

										If you're a leader in the software industry, perhaps you pause every now and then to ask yourself if you're a good one. 
										If not, I would encourage you to start. You may have been tagged as a natural leader when you were young. Some people 
										think they can spot "natural leaders" in much the same way you might spot a natural runner or a natural swimmer. Unfortunately, 
										being a good leader is much more complicated than that&mdash;it requires effort and intentionality. In particular, good leaders 
										evaluate their mistakes so they can learn from them.
									</p>
									<p>
										We all make mistakes. From my perspective, failure is less about the mistakes we make and more about our inability 
										to learn from them. But, wouldn't it be even better if we could learn from the mistakes of those around us? To that 
										end, let's take a look at some common leadership anti-patterns, or examples of what not to do. I hope you find a useful 
										nugget or two as we walk along the path.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://toughnickel.com/business/Common-Leadership-Anti-Patterns" target="_new">[READ MORE]</a><br/>
